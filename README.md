# Detection-of-Panic-Attacks


This Classifier is a component of bigger project I worked on with a team in my third year. Files that can be found here contain code and results of:
- accelerometer and gyroscope data pre-processing (including downsampling and filtering).
- traditional activity classification method.
- data analysis for the purpose of optimizing classifier for the purpose.
- optimized version of activity classifier that decides in which heart-rate-range group activity belongs to rather than classifying the activity itself.
